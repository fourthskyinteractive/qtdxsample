\class ctkPimpl ctkPimpl
\brief Hide private details of a class

Application code generally doesn't have to be concerned about hiding its
implementation details, but when writing library code it is important to
maintain a constant interface, both source and binary. Maintaining a constant
source interface is easy enough, but keeping the binary interface constant
means moving implementation details into a private class. The PIMPL, or
d-pointer, idiom is a common method of implementing this separation. ctkPimpl
offers a convenient way to connect the public and private sides of your class.

\section start Getting Started
Before you declare the public class, you need to make a forward declaration
of the private class. The private class must have the same name as the public
class, followed by the word Private.

\subsection pub The Public Class
Generally, you shouldn't keep any data members in the public class without a
good reason. Functions that are part of the public interface should be declared
in the public class, and functions that need to be available to subclasses (for
calling or overriding) should be in the protected section of the public class.
To connect the private class to the public class, include the
QCTK_DECLARE_PRIVATE macro in the private section of the public class. In the
example above, the private class is connected as follows:

Additionally, you must include the QCTK_INIT_PRIVATE macro in the public class's
constructor.

\subsection priv The Private Class
As mentioned above, data members should usually be kept in the private class.
This allows the memory layout of the private class to change without breaking
binary compatibility for the public class. Functions that exist only as
implementation details, or functions that need access to private data members,
should be implemented here.

To define the private class, inherit from the template qCTKPrivate class, and
include the QCTK_DECLARE_PUBLIC macro in its public section. The template
parameter should be the name of the public class.

\section cross Accessing Private Members
Use the qctk_d() function (actually a function-like object) from functions in
the public class to access the private class. Similarly, functions in the
private class can invoke functions in the public class by using the qctk_p()
function (this one's actually a function).
